# dk_municipalities
For a project, I needed to map municipalities in Denmark to their respective regions. This turned out to be a surprisingly difficult information to find a in a way that I could easily query and grab in a machine readable form. So, here is a CSV with the municipalities in Danish. Other data formats may show up later. 

Open to collaborate on this, and respond to requests to add more versions. 

## kommunerne.csv 
- municipalities and regions in Danish (i.e. Copenhagen is København)
- columns are 'Kommune', 'Region'
- decode with "ISO-8859-1"
